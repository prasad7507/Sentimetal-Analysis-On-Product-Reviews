0,"This is a nice wallet for the price however the color isn't at all what it appears online.  I ordered the pink and expected pink (like soft pink or cotton candy pink). The wallet is instead more of a peach /orange color.  Again, it's a nice wallet and I'll use it now that I have it but since my purse is pink it really doesn't match.  I can't speak for the other colors but I would beware when buying that the actual color may be different than represented online.  That being said, I was able to fit quite a few credit cards in the wallet and there is room for cash and other items as well.",1
1,Really inexpensive. Fit fine. Wrinkles easily.,1
2,"Nice looking belt. Fabric is far more stretchy then they indicate in the description. As a 34 waist, when I pull to tighten up, have at least 5-6 of overlap. Almost could have gone with a small I think. Works well if needing a belt for look, but if you need to cinch up a pair of pants/shorts that are a bit big, then you need to tighten it up a fair amount. Its NOT a solid leather/cloth belt. The tongue of the belt is also pretty wide so have to force through the loop as well as belt loops on pants/shorts. Not such a big deal, but is does rub the leather edges when needing to unbuckle. Time will tell if this begins to rub the stain off the leather or perhaps it wears in well with age.",1
3,The belts are quite flimsy and not as thick as I expected.  They will work but are not stiff and thick like others (of other colors) I own. They were delivered and promptly and in excellent condition.,1
4,"The bra fit ok. The cups ran a little big, and there is no support. I won't be able to wear this with many outfits because of that, plus, you can see the diagonal lines on the bra along with ""other things"" through your top. There needs to be a lining. The back support is pretty good. I'll probably just wear it around the house though.",1
5,Love this brand!! Been pleased with it for years! Never disappoints and the Jammie's last and last! Highly recommend!,1
6,My husband loves these cargo shorts ~ Excellent quality ~ Fits true to size ~ Launders well ~ Highly recommend,1
7,"Length wise they fit perfectly, but width is a little small. My little toes don't fit on the shoe too well.",1
8,"Seems and threading coming apart only after a few washes. Very pretty prints, but not holding up well for the price. Wish International shopping ctr was still there to buy these kinds of shorts.",1
9,My son LOVES these and they are so cute!,1
10,Very sweet.,1
11,"They are great for the value. For me finding a size 5 is very hard. I get most of mine from Q.V.C., It is the only place I can find a size 5''
Then I thought of Amazon and Bingo, got them and no shipping. It was great.",1
12,"Finely made product, great material and extremely stylish. It also comes in the exact same style but in black...which is what I got in the mail. Easy mix up I guess",1
13,I purchased shoes based on color my sons favorite but seems like the shoe runs short. We will keep it because returns hard and a Xmas present but wouldn't consider again at this point. Found another brand green a well but way better fit and he looked comfortable wearing them. We ill save the others for him to get on Xmas.,1
14,Good deal. Hanging strings are a bit too long.,1
15,"Love my purse, holds everything for me.",1
16,They're long for someone who is 5'2 but were a great alternative to gladiator sandals when paired with a Egyptian goddess costume.,1
17,"I bought these for my oldest granddaughter, who is turning 15.  They are very pretty, and I hope she likes them as much as I do.",1
18,"I bought the carry-on and larger suitcase from this set and loved the vibrant color and how much space they both have inside. However, on only my second trip I had to check the carry-on and it came back with the hard portion near the wheel completely cracked through. The airline offered me the cost of replacing it, but since it only lasted two trips, I'll be replacing it with another brand. Too bad. The color and storage space is great, but I can't afford to replace the whole set multiple times per year. This would be best for a car or infrequent traveler. Those of us who fly every week for work need something more sturdy.",1
19,Great shoes to wear with shorts or jean capris.  Glad I bought these after a suggestion from a friend.,1
20,Good,1
21,Fits great,1
22,Love it!  My granddaughter looked like a fairy princess for her 4th birthday.,1
23,"I got what's expected. Good replacement band for great watch. Just wish it was a bit cheaper, I could buy a cheap watch for the price of this Mudman band.",1
24,when i first purchase this item it took some super strength and a little wiggling to get it on. When i got it on it held in every thing nicely. the only bad thing i did not like is how it made my butt look like it was split.,1
25,"I have quite a few sweatshirts from Joe's.  They are wonderful, soft and warm.  I can always rely on the sizing.",1
26,Comfortable shoes for sure my favorite shoes.,1
27,"I recieved these yesterday, and they fit well and look good.  I've worn Rockports before, usually the ""World Tour"" shoes, this is the first time buying the Actiflex shoe, and so far I'm happy with them.",1
28,Thank you and I will buy from you again,1
29,Would have giveb it full five stars.. its larger than expected.. almost like a long chain which usually one wears with a maxi dress. I had not read the description. I thought would be small as a pendant. But its very prettty,1
30,More color options needed,1
31,Good product,1
32,"Too big , too long for x-large, nice color",1
33,love it but there is no drawstring in the pants,1
34,Awesome.  Loved them.,1
35,Great item for my 80's John McEnroe costume.  Probably more ideal for people with smaller calves (I have VERY large calves and they REALLY stretched around my calves).,1
36,Great quality but 1/2 the size I thought it would be! Child size.,1
37,"I absolutely love the style and quality of Born shoes, but unfortunately I have found through much experience that Born shoes in general run somewhat narrower than other brands of shoes.  I always have to put shoe stretchers in them to wear them because they do not make many wider styles.",1
38,I like this ring it satisfies my need,1
39,"Fits good. However, I ordered 6 pairs and only got 4 pairs.",1
40,Great tenis,1
41,"I was surprised at how nice this was, especially for the price.  Sure, you can tell the difference between it and one of the incredibly expensive ones, but for costume jewelry it's a good deal.  It was a Christmas gift for my niece, and when we Skyped the next day she had it on and was thrilled with it.  The little box it comes in is a nice touch.  I'm wondering if it'll end up getting tarnished soon, but I'd think with care and cleaning it should be good for some time.",1
42,Nice jacket!,1
43,"strong design
for the price its a bargain
wife was pleased so that says it all
I would recommend
Weighty, not just a knockoff piece but quality construction",1
44,Just needed to pin the belt because it was too big. And had to pin the top to my bra so the top would stay were it needed to. But overall I looked great in it and loved the costume. Thank you.,1
45,"I really love this, I wore it everyday and it broke. The pewter doesn't hold up to everyday wearing....wish it was stronger material.",1
46,"Darker than I expected, but are comfortable.",1
47,Love these shoes and a perfect fit!,1
48,Perfect for Colorado weather!,1
49,Its so beautiful and would be my favorite if not for the inexplicable TINY boob triangles?!?,1
50,This item is not true to size i needed to go a size up.,0
51,Dress came quickly but one and half sizes to small,0
52,Price was good but cheaply made,0
53,"The clutch is really cute.  Just a bit to small. Couldn't fit my Samsung S7 in it.
The worst was it took almost 6 weeks to arrive.  IF your considering purchasing this item, make sure you give yourself AMPLE time to receive.",0
54,Credit card slots way too tight for standard US credit cards. Some stitches already popped. Disappointed because it's a beautiful wallet otherwise.,0
55,"Shoes are beautiful, but too wide and run larger.  Our daughter is unable to wear them at this time",0
56,Fits very small in size.,0
57,not enough larger sizes and some permanent pieces not screw on tip.  unusuable for me.  many pieces and worth buying but not what expected on many of piecee.,0
58,I bought a pair in December 2015. It's October 2016 and sole has lost most of its grip. I wear these to work only with select attire about once or twice a week. These are definitely waterproof but quality of sole is very inferior - probably same material as some sort of cheap eraser. I expected better quality considering the brand name.,0
59,Do not put in the dryer. Ever. Shrinkaroo.,0
60,"Its okay, nice clasp. However, its very shiny, looks cheaply made. Also, the clasp works its way around to the charm constantly. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but not worth sending back",0
61,"The size, number of card slots and small zippered pocket were what I wanted to replace a beloved Nine West wallet. The RFID was a plus. However, after only a month or two the key ring tore off. Because it is so inexpensive, I could easily replace it but considering my old wallet lasted five years and was still usable if worn, the best I can say is this is okay.",0
62,The silver is not real!! It faded too fast!!!!,0
63,Good fit but one of the armpits was ripped,0
64,Order  at least on size larger!!!,0
65,These socks shrunk after wash and dried . I cannot wear it now because too  small for my feet now. Donated them,0
66,Cute boots but was to tight when I first put it on. I guess it'll have to loosen up then I should be ok,0
67,There is no way to wear this as a dress. I just have to wear it as a top  The belt is just a loose thin black string that is not attached and no belt loops so  I had to wear as a top.,0
68,they run small.,0
69,"I was really disappointed in the sizing. I even compensated for,the smaller cut.",0
70,shirt fit well and is super cute. Shorts were wayyyy too tight around the waist and I am a small person and I ordered small.,0
71,VERY CHEAPLY MADE...necklace broke as I was putting it on my daughter's neck. DISAPPOINTED!,0
72,"It just feel cheap ,I returned it right away.",0
73,"I usually wear an 8.5 shoe.  I ordered this in a 9 because there are no half sizes.  It is a bit short and my toes are pressed tight to the front of the shoe.  I think a 10 will be too big and flop around in the water, so I'll keep these.  I only wear them for my water aerobics class 3x a week.",0
74,"its ok. but kind of low quality, the cabinets below they separated not evenly.",0
75,"The strap started to rip from seam within 3 weeks and then ripped completely off the next day. It was for a kindergartener so there was only a folder, small reading book, and lunch box. I was sad because he really loved the bag. I thought the picture on the bag had good quality but the straps need to be more secured.",0
76,"I ordered two Grey shirts sizes 34. One of them fits like a 32 and the other fits like a 33. They both smell like fish, like they came here by boat from china or something. I also ordered pants from the same brand and same size that fit like normal and did not smell like fish. Same your money and go to Walmart. You will end up sending these back",0
77,"My husband subscribed to Amazon Prime, so he told me to shop for the shoes I was looking for under his name, (which is why the review name is a man's.) These shoes listed their European sizes a little differently than most other brands.  I should've believed them when they said that a 39 is a US size 8-9 in women's.  They definitely run on the smaller of that sizing.  (Most 39s would be comparable to an 8.5-9.)  Also, I felt like I was sliding downhill in them, but I'm not sure if it's only because they ran smaller and that made them fit strangely.
The color of the leather was nice, but honestly...the soles are not pretty at all.  They look like they were supposed to look like wood, but they just look like a dirty-colored sole.
The most disappointing part of buying them was that the original ad said ""Amazon Prime"" next to the shoe, and then when I selected them I didn't think to read the fine print, which said ""not eligible for Amazon Prime"".  Very disappointed with Amazon's advertising.  I feel it was misleading.  Now it will cost me over $16 in shipping to return them.",0
78,Picture doesn't match actual product. Material is a lot cheaper than displayed. Additionally had two buttons pop off as soon as I opened the packaging.,0
79,"This is a nice watch, but the ad was miss leading. I was under the impression it was the collection, not just one watch! Here it the description on the listing
""Product Description
Reliance By Croton Men's Sport Trio Watch Collection Choices: Silver-tone, Brown, or Black bezels A stylish and sporty set of accessories sure to find a permanent place in your everyday attire! This handsome set of three watches from Croton features a different complication on each watch including chronograph, compass, and date window. Each watch comes packaged in its own box so you can keep all of them for yourself or divide them up and give them as gifts!""
 But I guess it was a lesson learned in the old saying ""Buyer Beware""!!",0
80,Very fun and fit well but one of the layers started falling off the first time I wore it.,0
81,A little disappointed. I ordered these sunglasses specifically the black frames with the blue lenses. When they got here they were gold franes. I really don't feel like going through the hassle of returning them and getting another pair.,0
82,Not the quality I wanted but good for the price. Just didn't fit. I'm a solid size 10 and it was too small,0
83,Too big,0
84,"Not impressed with this slip- it twists while being worn, which is uncomfortable and can mess with the neckline of whatever dress you're wearing over the top. This seems to be because there is a small slit (approx 3 inches) cut into one side, but not the other. I won't be wearing it under anything with a neckline below the centre of my chest.",0
85,These shoes were really long!  I always wear an 8.5 but these were at least a full size too big,0
86,"Too tiny, use it for a tool bag instead for gym.",0
87,This might be a good looking pair of shoes but it is very uncomfortable and the sizes run too small.,0
88,not what I expected.,0
89,it's really pretty but way small and not as pretty as model wears,0
90,I'm sure that the quality is good and it did arrive on time. The fit is terrible. I have read that the Stetsons have a round fit but I have an oval head. Baily is supposed to have an oval fit.,0
91,Hemline is even all the way around.  Not the handkerchief hemline as pictured.,0
92,I don't recommend buying this backpack. The material is cheap and it has bad sewing so my strap broke within the first week of use,0
93,Loved them BUT way to SMALL!!!  Sent back but no half size . sooo disapointed!,0
94,I do not like the strap. It's Sharpe and cuts into your neck or shoulders.  The bag itself is nice.,0
95,"I got this to use as a back up while my Apple watch is in the charger. The Indiglo works, easy to read, but its lousy at keeping time. Its not unusual for it to drop behind 15 minutes at a time. Not dependable enough to rely on.",0
96,"BEWARE, BOX LABELED WIDE, SHOE IS NOT. SHOE IS NOT WIDE. NEEDED THOSE FOR AN IMPORTANT EVENT IN LESS THAN 2 DAYS.",0
97,Wow! It really runs small. I wear a size 12 and ordered the XL. It barely fits.,0
98,"I had gotten two of the 4 packs of wool blend with the flecked yarn - love them and they keep my feet warm.  I ordered a three pack that had colors that I needed.  These are not wool at all and the colors are streaked and horrible. They don't keep my feet warm and I can't wear them out of the house because of the coloring.  Too late to return them.  Note to self - read everything carefully, especially the reviews!

The socks in the picture are great - the ones that is I hate are in the 3-pack of solid looking red, green and brown.",0
99,"The buckle of this product feels a bit cheap, but with that being said, I've had it for over a year.  I travel halfway across the world once a month...go through at least three airports on each trip and I've never had any trouble with it.  I can put as much as $1500 inside of it and wear it through the metal detectors with no problem.  Although the buckle does feel a little cheap and I don't expect it to last forever, when it breaks, I will buy another one just like it.",0
